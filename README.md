# Web Server
 Here I would create a simple web server code 

step-1 
create a folder my app or my server anything..
after that create folders:-
public--> it contains static data or files such as css,js files things that we need to serve directly to the client 
views--> it stores templates or views that define the structure or layout of the web site 
servr.js--> contains requests and response data 

step-2 
after creating that write npm init to install the package.json file 
then install the express--> npm i express
